How do political ceremonies establish authority? Why does repetition characterize anthems and ritual speech? Why were circular forms favored for public festivals during the French Revolution? This book answers these questions using a single concept: common knowledge. Game theory shows that in order to coordinate its actions, a group of people must form ""common knowledge."" Each person wants to participate only if others also participate. Members must have knowledge of each other, knowledge of that knowledge, knowledge of the knowledge of that knowledge, and so on. Michael Chwe applies this insight, with striking erudition, to analyze a range of rituals across history and cultures. He shows that public ceremonies are powerful not simply because they transmit meaning from a central source to each audience member but because they let audience members know what other members know.","ritual speech, circular forms, public festivals, revolution, transmit meaning",15.751,465065694,Moises Naim,Paperback,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41WWSSV6ZiL.jpg,9.78047E+12,320,31,1173,3.61,2631,"The End of Power: From Boardrooms to Battlefields and Churches to States, Why Being In Charge Isn't What It Used to Be",https://www.amazon.com/End-Power-Boardrooms-Battlefields-Churches/dp/0465065694?SubscriptionId=AKIAJZAKURNIAY4STOJQ&tag=karslucon-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=0465065694,79.30413917,25,1.506316516,3.313289564,35.2701519,The End of Power,"We know that power is shifting: From West to East and North to South, from presidential palaces to public squares, from once formidable corporate behemoths to nimble startups and, slowly but surely, from men to women.

In this incisive critique, former litigator-turned-legal-scholar Michelle Alexander provocatively argues that we have not ended racial caste in America: we have simply redesigned it. Alexander shows that, by targeting black men and decimating communities of color, the U.S. criminal justice system functions as a contemporary system of racial control, even as it formally adheres to the principle of color blindness. The New Jim Crow challenges the civil rights community--and all of us--to place mass incarceration at the forefront of a new movement for racial justice in America.","",232.720,9.78023E+12,Thomas S.

The Structure of Scientific Revolutions is that kind of book. When it was first published in 1962, it was a landmark event in the history and philosophy of science. Fifty years later, it still has many lessons to teach.With The Structure of Scientific Revolutions, Kuhn challenged long-standing linear notions of scientific progress, arguing that transformative ideas don't arise from the day-to-day, gradual process of experimentation and data accumulation but that the revolutions in science, those breakthrough moments that disrupt accepted thinking and offer unanticipated ideas, occur outside of "normal science," as he called it. Though Kuhn was writing when physics ruled the sciences, his ideas on how scientific revolutions bring order to the anomalies that amass over time in research experiments are still instructive in our biotech age.","",233.621,9.78006E+12,Yuval Noah Harari,Paperback,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51zJS6PmxbL.jpg,9.78006E+12,464,36,1476,4.45,163941,Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind,https://www.amazon.com/Sapiens-Humankind-Yuval-Noah-Harari/dp/0062316117?SubscriptionId=AKIAJZAKURNIAY4STOJQ&tag=karslucon-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=0062316117,61.12777445,95,100,24.375,85.37592482,Sapiens,"How did our species succeed in the battle for dominance? Why did our foraging ancestors come together to create cities and kingdoms? How did we come to believe in gods, nations and human rights; to trust money, books and laws; and to be enslaved by bureaucracy, timetables and consumerism? And what will our world be like in the millennia to come? In Sapiens, Dr Yuval Noah Harari spans the whole of human history, from the very first humans to walk the earth to the radical - and sometimes devastating - breakthroughs of the Cognitive, Agricultural and Scientific Revolutions. Drawing on insights from biology, anthropology, paleontology and economics, he explores how the currents of history have shaped our human societies, the animals and plants around us, and even our personalities. Have we become happier as history has unfolded? Can we ever free our behaviour from the heritage of our ancestors? And what, if anything, can we do to influence the course of the centuries to come?","",223.722,9.78077E+12,Cixin Liu,Paperback,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51K9TXzOqiL.jpg,9.78077E+12,416,41,998,4.04,72507,The Three-Body Problem,https://www.amazon.com/Three-Body-Problem-Cixin-Liu/dp/0765382032?SubscriptionId=AKIAJZAKURNIAY4STOJQ&tag=karslucon-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=0765382032,89.80203959,60.83333333,44.17164803,63.12562267,64.93567365,The Three-Body Problem,"Set against the backdrop of China's Cultural Revolution, a secret military project sends signals into space to establish contact with aliens.
