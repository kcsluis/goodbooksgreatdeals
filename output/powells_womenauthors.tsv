9	9780679763888	Isabel Wilkerson	Paperback	In this epic, beautifully written masterwork, Pulitzer Prize–winning author Isabel Wilkerson chronicles one of the great untold stories of American history: the decades-long migration of black citizens who fled the South for northern and western cities, in search of a better life.NATIONAL BOOK CRITICS CIRCLE AWARD WINNERLYNTON HISTORY PRIZE WINNERHEARTLAND AWARD WINNER DAYTON LITERARY PEACE PRIZE FINALIST      NAMED ONE OF THE TEN BEST BOOKS OF THE YEAR BYThe New York Times  • USA Today • O: The Oprah Magazine • Amazon • Publishers Weekly •  Salon • Newsday  • The Daily Beast NAMED ONE OF THE BEST BOOKS OF THE YEAR BYThe New Yorker •  The Washington Post • The Economist • Boston Globe • San Francisco Chronicle •  Chicago  Tribune • Entertainment Weekly • Philadelphia Inquirer • The Guardian • The Seattle Times • St. Louis Post-Dispatch  • The Christian Science Monitor  From 1915 to 1970, this exodus of almost six million people changed the face of America. Wilkerson compares this epic migration to the migrations of other peoples in history. She interviewed more than a thousand people, and gained access to new data and official records, to write this definitive and vividly dramatic account of how these American journeys unfolded, altering our cities, our country, and ourselves. With stunning historical detail, Wilkerson tells this story through the lives of three unique individuals: Ida Mae Gladney, who in 1937 left sharecropping and prejudice in Mississippi for Chicago, where she achieved quiet blue-collar success and, in old age, voted for Barack Obama when he ran for an Illinois Senate seat; sharp and quick-tempered George Starling, who in 1945 fled Florida for Harlem, where he endangered his job fighting for civil rights, saw his family fall, and finally found peace in God; and Robert Foster, who left Louisiana in 1953 to pursue a medical career, the personal physician to Ray Charles as part of a glitteringly successful medical career, which allowed him to purchase a grand home where he often threw exuberant parties.Wilkerson brilliantly captures their first treacherous and exhausting cross-country trips by car and train and their new lives in colonies that grew into ghettos, as well as how they changed these cities with southern food, faith, and culture and improved them with discipline, drive, and hard work. Both a riveting microcosm and a major assessment, The Warmth of Other Suns is a bold, remarkable, and riveting work, a superb account of an “unrecognized immigration” within our own land. Through the breadth of its narrative, the beauty of the writing, the depth of its research, and the fullness of the people and lives portrayed herein, this book is destined to become a classic.	https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61IBluU1ZiL.jpg	9780679763888	640	55	803	4.35	43600	The Warmth of Other Suns	https://www.amazon.com/Warmth-Other-Suns-Americas-Migration/dp/0679763880?SubscriptionId=AKIAJZAKURNIAY4STOJQ&tag=karslucon-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=0679763880	87.88	67.5	100.0	255.38

It focuses on such subjects as John Wayne and Howard Hughes, growing up a girl in California, ruminating on the nature of good and evil in a Death Valley motel room, and, especially, the essence of San Francisco's Haight-Ashbury, the heart of the counterculture.	https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41ULaIpZwsL.jpg	9780374531386	256	32	1020	4.22	28600	Slouching Towards Bethlehem	https://www.amazon.com/Slouching-Towards-Bethlehem-Essays-Classics/dp/0374531382?SubscriptionId=AKIAJZAKURNIAY4STOJQ&tag=karslucon-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=0374531382	79.2	61.0	100.0	240.2
10	067974195X	Jane Jacobs	Paperback	A direct and fundamentally optimistic indictment of the short-sightedness and intellectual arrogance that has characterized much of urban planning in this century, The Death and Life of Great American Cities has, since its first publication in 1961, become the standard against which all endeavors in that field are measured. In prose of outstanding immediacy, Jane Jacobs writes about what makes streets safe or unsafe; about what constitutes a neighborhood, and what function it serves within the larger organism of the city; about why some neighborhoods remain impoverished while others regenerate themselves. She writes about the salutary role of funeral parlors and tenement windows, the dangers of too much development money and too little diversity. Compassionate, bracingly indignant, and always keenly detailed, Jane Jacobs's monumental work provides an essential framework for assessing the vitality of all cities.	https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41czx9OKhpL.jpg	9780679741954	458	32	1152	4.31	10400	The Death and Life of Great American Cities	https://www.amazon.com/Death-Life-Great-American-Cities/dp/067974195X?SubscriptionId=AKIAJZAKURNIAY4STOJQ&tag=karslucon-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=067974195X	73.92	65.5	100.0	239.42

Reilly, Lionel Shriver’s resonant story of a mother’s unsettling quest to understand her teenage son’s deadly violence, her own ambivalence toward motherhood, and the explosive link between them reverberates with the haunting power of high hopes shattered by dark realities. Like Shriver’s charged and incisive later novels, including So Much for That and The Post-Birthday World, We Need to Talk About Kevin is a piercing, unforgettable, and penetrating exploration of violence, family ties, and responsibility, a book that the Boston Globe describes as “sometimes searing . . . [and] impossible to put down.”	https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41mWK6BnelL.jpg	9780062119049	432	45	933	4.08	137500	We Need To Talk About Kevin	https://www.amazon.com/We-Need-Talk-About-Kevin/dp/0062119044?SubscriptionId=AKIAJZAKURNIAY4STOJQ&tag=karslucon-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=0062119044	82.68	54.0	100.0	236.68

16	1983888257	Mary Wollstonecraft Shelley	Paperback	"Frankenstein; or, The Modern Prometheus is a novel written by English author Mary Shelley (1797–1851) that tells the story of Victor Frankenstein, a young scientist who creates a grotesque but sapient creature in an unorthodox scientific experiment. Shelley started writing the story when she was 18, and the first edition of the novel was published anonymously in London on 1 January 1818, when she was 20. Her name first appeared on the second edition, published in France in 1823. Shelley travelled through Europe in 1814, journeying along the river Rhine in Germany with a stop in Gernsheim which is 17 km (10 mi) away from Frankenstein Castle, where, two centuries before, an alchemist was engaged in experiments. Later, she travelled in the region of Geneva (Switzerland)—where much of the story takes place—and the topic of galvanism and other similar occult ideas were themes of conversation among her companions, particularly her lover and future husband, Percy Shelley. Mary, Percy, Lord Byron and John Polidori decided to have a competition to see who could write the best horror story. After thinking for days, Shelley dreamt about a scientist who created life and was horrified by what he had made; her dream later evolved into the novel's story. Frankenstein is infused with elements of the Gothic novel and the Romantic movement. At the same time, it is an early example of science fiction. Brian Aldiss has argued that it should be considered the first true science fiction story because, in contrast to previous stories with fantastical elements resembling those of later science fiction, the central character ""makes a deliberate decision"" and ""turns to modern experiments in the laboratory"" to achieve fantastic results. It has had a considerable influence in literature and popular culture and spawned a complete genre of horror stories, films and plays."	https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/414qA5cZW2L.jpg	9781983888250	100		699	3.78	1009100	Frankenstein	https://www.amazon.com/Frankenstein-Mary-Wollstonecraft-Shelley/dp/1983888257?SubscriptionId=AKIAJZAKURNIAY4STOJQ&tag=karslucon-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=1983888257	92.04	39.0	100.0	231.04

8	0141439548	George Eliot	Paperback	George Eliot's Victorian masterpiece: a magnificent portrait of a provincial town and its inhabitantsGeorge Eliot’s novel, Middlemarch: A Study of Provincial Life, explores a fictional nineteenth-century Midlands town in the midst of modern changes. The proposed Reform Bill promises political change; the building of railroads alters both the physical and cultural landscape; new scientific approaches to medicine incite public division; and scandal lurks behind respectability. The quiet drama of ordinary lives and flawed choices are played out in the complexly portrayed central characters of the novel—the idealistic Dorothea Brooke; the ambitious Dr. Lydgate; the spendthrift Fred Vincy; and the steadfast Mary Garth. The appearance of two outsiders further disrupts the town’s equilibrium—Will Ladislaw, the spirited nephew of Dorothea’s husband, the Rev. Edward Casaubon, and the sinister John Raffles, who threatens to expose the hidden past of one of the town’s elite. Middlemarch displays George Eliot’s clear-eyed yet humane understanding of characters caught up in the mysterious unfolding of self-knowledge. This Penguin Classics edition uses the second edition of 1874 and features an introduction and notes by Eliot-biographer Rosemary Ashton. In her introduction, Ashton discusses themes of social change in Middlemarch, and examines the novel as an imaginative embodiment of Eliot's humanist beliefs.For more than sixty-five years, Penguin has been the leading publisher of classic literature in the English-speaking world.

24	9780345384560	Karen Armstrong	Paperback	Why does God exist? How have the three dominant monotheistic religions—Judaism, Christianity, and Islam—shaped and altered the conception of God? How have these religions influenced each other? In this stunningly intelligent book, Karen Armstrong, one of Britain's foremost commentators on religious affairs, traces the history of how men and women have perceived and experienced God, from the time of Abraham to the present. The epic story begins with the Jews' gradual transformation of pagan idol worship in Babylon into true monotheism—a concept previously unknown in the world. Christianity and Islam both rose on the foundation of this revolutionary idea, but these religions refashioned 'the One God' to suit the social and political needs of their followers. From classical philosophy and medieval mysticism to the Reformation, Karen Armstrong performs the near miracle of distilling the intellectual history of monotheism into one superbly readable volume, destined to take its place as a classic.Praise for History of God“An admirable and impressive work of synthesis that will give insight and satisfaction to thousands of lay readers.”—The Washington Post Book World“A brilliantly lucid, spendidly readable book. [Karen] Armstrong has a dazzling ability: she can take a long and complex subject and reduce it to the fundamentals, without oversimplifying.”—The Sunday Times (London)“Absorbing . . .

I think that beyond being about the very nature of reality, it is itself a vision of reality.”—Eudora Welty, from the Introduction.The serene and maternal Mrs. Ramsay, the tragic yet absurd Mr. Ramsay, and their children and assorted guests are on holiday on the Isle of Skye. From the seemingly trivial postponement of a visit to a nearby lighthouse, Woolf constructs a remarkable, moving examination of the complex tensions and allegiances of family life and the conflict between men and women.	https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51ZtQidg%2B8L.jpg	9780156907392	209	40	894	3.77	110800	To the Lighthouse	https://www.amazon.com/Lighthouse-Virginia-Woolf/dp/0156907399?SubscriptionId=AKIAJZAKURNIAY4STOJQ&tag=karslucon-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=0156907399	84.24	38.5	100.0	222.74
4	0811219496	Clarice Lispector	Paperback	A new edition of Clarice Lispector’s final masterpiece, now with a vivid introduction by Colm Tóibín. Narrated by the cosmopolitan Rodrigo S.M., this brief, strange, and haunting tale is the story of Macabéa, one of life's unfortunates. Living in the slums of Rio and eking out a poor living as a typist, Macabéa loves movies, Coca-Colas, and her rat of a boyfriend; she would like to be like Marilyn Monroe, but she is ugly, underfed, sickly and unloved. Rodrigo recoils from her wretchedness, and yet he cannot avoid the realization that for all her outward misery, Macabéa is inwardly free/She doesn't seem to know how unhappy she should be. Lispector employs her pathetic heroine against her urbane, empty narrator―edge of despair to edge of despair―and, working them like a pair of scissors, she cuts away the reader's preconceived notions about poverty, identity, love and the art of fiction. In her last book she takes readers close to the true mystery of life and leave us deep in Lispector territory indeed.	https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51xTGisRwiL.jpg	9780811219495	128	5	1230	3.98	12200	The Hour of the Star	https://www.amazon.com/Hour-Star-Second-Clarice-Lispector/dp/0811219496?SubscriptionId=AKIAJZAKURNIAY4STOJQ&tag=karslucon-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=0811219496	70.8	49.0	100.0	219.8

This breakout book by Alison Bechdel is a darkly funny family tale, pitch-perfectly illustrated with Bechdel's sweetly gothic drawings. Like Marjane Satrapi's Persepolis, it's a story exhilaratingly suited to graphic memoir form. Meet Alison's father, a historic preservation expert and obsessive restorer of the family's Victorian home, a third-generation funeral home director, a high school English teacher, an icily distant parent, and a closeted homosexual who, as it turns out, is involved with his male students and a family babysitter. Through narrative that is alternately heartbreaking and fiercely funny, we are drawn into a daughter's complex yearning for her father. And yet, apart from assigned stints dusting caskets at the family-owned ""fun home,"" as Alison and her brothers call it, the relationship achieves its most intimate expression through the shared code of books. When Alison comes out as homosexual herself in late adolescense, the denouement is swift, graphic -- and redemptive."	https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51ocqhN1KOL.jpg	9780618871711	232	12	1495	4.09	108000	Fun Home	https://www.amazon.com/Fun-Home-Tragicomic-Alison-Bechdel/dp/0618871713?SubscriptionId=AKIAJZAKURNIAY4STOJQ&tag=karslucon-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=0618871713	60.2	54.5	100.0	214.7

As Bruno carries out his twisted plan, Guy is trapped in Highsmith's perilous world, where, under the right circumstances, anybody is capable of murder.The inspiration for Alfred Hitchcock's classic 1951 film, Strangers on a Train launched Highsmith on a prolific career of noir fiction, proving her a master at depicting the unsettling forces that tremble beneath the surface of everyday contemporary life."	https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51YICz8X2yL.jpg	9780393321982	256	16	1263	3.79	14400	Strangers on a Train	https://www.amazon.com/Strangers-Train-Patricia-Highsmith/dp/0393321983?SubscriptionId=AKIAJZAKURNIAY4STOJQ&tag=karslucon-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=0393321983	69.48	39.5	100.0	208.98
18	9780143037248	Rebecca Solnit	Paperback	A stimulating exploration of wandering, being lost, and the uses of the unknown from the author of Men Explain Things To MeWritten as a series of autobiographical essays, A Field Guide to Getting Lost draws on emblematic moments and relationships in Rebecca Solnit's life to explore issues of uncertainty, trust, loss, memory, desire, and place. Solnit is interested in the stories we use to navigate our way through the world, and the places we traverse, from wilderness to cities, in finding ourselves, or losing ourselves. While deeply personal, her own stories link up to larger stories, from captivity narratives of early Americans to the use of the color blue in Renaissance painting, not to mention encounters with tortoises, monks, punk rockers, mountains, deserts, and the movie Vertigo. The result is a distinctive, stimulating voyage of discovery.	https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51x3EkNKT6L.jpg	9780143037248	224	26	1335	3.99	8500	A Field Guide to Getting Lost	https://www.amazon.com/Field-Guide-Getting-Lost/dp/0143037242?SubscriptionId=AKIAJZAKURNIAY4STOJQ&tag=karslucon-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=0143037242	66.6	49.5	84.8484848485	200.948484848

21	1566893542	Valeria Luiselli	Paperback	"""An extraordinary new literary talent.""--The Daily Telegraph""In part a portrait of the artist as a young woman, this deceptively modest-seeming, astonishingly inventive novel creates an extraordinary intimacy, a sensibility so alive it quietly takes over all your senses, quivering through your nerve endings, opening your eyes and heart. Youth, from unruly student years to early motherhood and a loving marriage--and then, in the book's second half, wilder and something else altogether, the fearless, half-mad imagination of youth, I might as well call it--has rarely been so freshly, charmingly, and unforgettably portrayed. Valeria Luiselli is a masterful, entirely original writer.""--Francisco Goldman""Luiselli's haunting debut novel, about a young mother living in Mexico City who writes a novel looking back on her time spent working as a translator of obscure works at a small independent press in Harlem, erodes the concrete borders of everyday life with a beautiful, melancholy contemplation of disappearance. . . . Luiselli plays with the idea of time and identity with grace and intuition."" --Publishers WeeklyIn Mexico City, a young mother is writing a novel of her days as a translator living in New York. In Harlem, a translator is desperate to publish the works of Gilberto Owen, an obscure Mexican poet. And in Philadelphia, Gilberto Owen recalls his friendship with Lorca, and the young woman he saw in the windows of passing trains. Valeria Luiselli's debut signals the arrival of a major international writer and an unexpected and necessary voice in contemporary fiction.
