24	9780465050659	Don Norman	Paperback	The ultimate guide to human-centered design Even the smartest among us can feel inept as we fail to figure out which light switch or oven burner to turn on, or whether to push, pull, or slide a door. The fault, argues this ingenious-even liberating-book, lies not in ourselves, but in product design that ignores the needs of users and the principles of cognitive psychology. The problems range from ambiguous and hidden controls to arbitrary relationships between controls and functions, coupled with a lack of feedback or other assistance and unreasonable demands on memorization.The Design of Everyday Things shows that good, usable design is possible. The rules are simple: make things visible, exploit natural relationships that couple function and control, and make intelligent use of constraints. The goal: guide the user effortlessly to the right action on the right control at the right time.The Design of Everyday Things is a powerful primer on how--and why--some products satisfy customers while others only frustrate them.	https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/410RTQezHYL.jpg	9780465050659	368	32	1292	4.19	19500	The Design of Everyday Things	https://www.amazon.com/Design-Everyday-Things-Revised-Expanded/dp/0465050654?SubscriptionId=AKIAJZAKURNIAY4STOJQ&tag=karslucon-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=0465050654	68.32	59.5	100.0	227.82

25	9780061766084	Tim Brown	Hardcover	The myth of innovation is that brilliant ideas leap fully formed from the minds of geniuses. The reality is that most innovations come from a process of rigorous examination through which great ideas are identified and developed before being realized as new offerings and capabilities.  This book introduces the idea of design thinking‚ the collaborative process by which the designer′s sensibilities and methods are employed to match people′s needs not only with what is technically feasible and a viable business strategy. In short‚ design thinking converts need into demand. It′s a human−centered approach to problem solving that helps people and organizations become more innovative and more creative.  Design thinking is not just applicable to so−called creative industries or people who work in the design field. It′s a methodology that has been used by organizations such as Kaiser Permanente to increase the quality of patient care by re−examining the ways that their nurses manage shift change‚ or Kraft to rethink supply chain management. This is not a book by designers for designers; this is a book for creative leaders seeking to infuse design thinking into every level of an organization‚ product‚ or service to drive new alternatives for business and society.	https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41-aaVMQaFL.jpg	9780061766084	272	51	1458	3.91	6600	Change By Design	https://www.amazon.com/Change-Design-Transforms-Organizations-Innovation/dp/0061766089?SubscriptionId=AKIAJZAKURNIAY4STOJQ&tag=karslucon-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=0061766089	61.68	45.5	65.6565656566	172.836565657

16	0141035811	Bruno Munari	Paperback	One of the last surviving members of the futurist generation, Bruno Munari's Design as Art is an illustrated journey into the artistic possibilities of modern design translated by Patrick Creagh published as part of the 'Penguin on Design' series in Penguin Modern Classics. 'The designer of today re-establishes the long-lost contact between art and the public, between living people and art as a living thing' Bruno Munari was among the most inspirational designers of all time, described by Picasso as 'the new Leonardo'. Munari insisted that design be beautiful, functional and accessible, and this enlightening and highly entertaining book sets out his ideas about visual, graphic and industrial design and the role it plays in the objects we use everyday. Lamps, road signs, typography, posters, children's books, advertising, cars and chairs - these are just some of the subjects to which he turns his illuminating gaze. How do we see the world around us? The Penguin on Design series includes the works of creative thinkers whose writings on art, design and the media have changed our vision forever. Bruno Munari (1907-1998), born in Milan, was the enfant terrible of Italian art and design for most of the twentieth century, contributing to many fields of both visual (paint, sculpture, film, industrial design, graphics) and non-visual arts (literature, poetry). He was twice awarded the Compasso d'Oro design prize for excellence in his field. If you enjoyed Design as Art, you might like John Berger's Ways of Seeing, also available in Penguin Modern Classics.

20	0500203474	Richard Hollis	Paperback	"From its roots in the development of printing, graphic design has evolved as a means of identification, information, and promotion to become a profession and discipline in its own right. This authoritative documentary history begins with the poster and goes on to chart the development of word and image in brochures and magazines, advertising, corporate identity, television, and electronic media, and the impact of technical innovations such as photography and the computer. For the revised edition, a new final chapter covers all the recent international developments in graphic design, including the role of the computer and the Internet in design innovation and globalization. In the last years of the twentieth century, at a time when ""designer products"" and the use of logos grew in importance, the role of graphic designers became more complex, subversive, and sometimes more politicalâ€•witness Oliviero Toscani's notorious advertisements for Benetton. Digital technology cleared the way for an astonishing proliferation of new typefaces, and words began to take second place to typography in a whole range of magazines and books as designers asserted the primacy of their medium. Designers and companies discussed here include Neville Brody, David Carson, Design Writing Research, Edward Fella, Tibor Kalman, Jeffery Keedy, LettError, Pierre di Sciullo, Tomato, Gerard Unger, Cornel Windlin, and a host of others.

31	9780262701150	John Thackara	Paperback	"How to design a world in which we rely less on stuff, and more on people.We're filling up the world with technology and devices, but we've lost sight of an important question: What is this stuff for? What value does it add to our lives? So asks author John Thackara in his new book, In the Bubble: Designing for a Complex World. These are tough questions for the pushers of technology to answer. Our economic system is centered on technology, so it would be no small matter if ""tech"" ceased to be an end-in-itself in our daily lives. Technology is not going to go away, but the time to discuss the end it will serve is before we deploy it, not after. We need to ask what purpose will be served by the broadband communications, smart materials, wearable computing, and connected appliances that we're unleashing upon the world. We need to ask what impact all this stuff will have on our daily lives. Who will look after it, and how?In the Bubble is about a world based less on stuff and more on people. Thackara describes a transformation that is taking place now―not in a remote science fiction future; it's not about, as he puts it, ""the schlock of the new"" but about radical innovation already emerging in daily life. We are regaining respect for what people can do that technology can't. In the Bubble describes services designed to help people carry out daily activities in new ways. Many of these services involve technology―ranging from body implants to wide-bodied jets. But objects and systems play a supporting role in a people-centered world. The design focus is on services, not things. And new principles―above all, lightness―inform the way these services are designed and used. At the heart of In the Bubble is a belief, informed by a wealth of real-world examples, that ethics and responsibility can inform design decisions without impeding social and technical innovation."	https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/4172PKS8J0L.jpg	9780262701150	332	49	1176	3.99	300	In the Bubble: Designing in a Complex World	https://www.amazon.com/Bubble-Designing-Complex-World-Press/dp/0262701154?SubscriptionId=AKIAJZAKURNIAY4STOJQ&tag=karslucon-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=0262701154	72.96	49.5	2.0202020202	124.48020202

11	1616890304	Lois Weinthal	Paperback	Interior design, as a relatively young discipline within the academic world of design, has historically been interpreted as an extension of other fine arts. Narratives exist, but they all too often treat interior design as a function of architecture or display rather than experience. An independent interior design theory is virtually nonexistent. Professor Lois Weinthal envisions a future where interior design is treated with parity to architecture and industrial design, a future with a new interior. A reader for architects and interior designers, Weinthal has carefully curated a collection of forty-eight essays that will form the foundation of interior design theory and shape future interior space. Her introductory essays illuminate each source, prefacing and directing discussion of the material as it relates to interior design theory. Alluding to Le Corbusier s classic text, she has organized this material into a framework that inspires conversation, marking a break with the past and forming a new vocabulary for the discourse. Contributions to the book s eight sections include essays by David Batchelor, Aaron Betsky, Petra Blaisse, Andrew Blauvelt, Beatriz Colomina, Le Corbusier, Robin Evans, Adolf Loos, Ellen Lupton, Charlotte Perkins Gilman, Michel Serres, Henry Urbach, Wim Wenders, and Mark Wigley.	https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51WzUawOuSL.jpg	9781616890308	648	52	2401	4.54	0	Toward a New Interior	https://www.amazon.com/Toward-New-Interior-Lois-Weinthal/dp/1616890304?SubscriptionId=AKIAJZAKURNIAY4STOJQ&tag=karslucon-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=1616890304	23.96	77.0	0.0	100.96

3	1616890363	Kimberly Elam	Paperback	At last, a mathematical explanation of how art works presented in a manner we can all understand. Kimberly Elam takes the reader on a geometrical journey, lending insight and coherence to the design process by exploring the visual relationships that have foundations in mathematics as well as the essential qualities of life. Geometry of Design takes a close look at a broad range of twentieth-century examples of design, architecture, and illustration (from the Barcelona chair to the paintings of Georges Seurat, from the Braun hand blender to the Conico kettle), revealing underlying geometric structures in their compositions. Explanations and techniques of visual analysis make the inherent mathematical relationships evident and a must-have for anyone involved in art, design, or architecture graphic arts. The book focuses not only on the classic systems of proportioning, such as the golden section and root rectangles, but also on less well known proportioning systems such as the Fibonacci Series. Through detailed diagrams these geometric systems are brought to life giving an effective insight into the design process.	https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41IBwFQKu7L.jpg	9781616890360	144	7	2324	4.08	500	Geometry of Design	https://www.amazon.com/Geometry-Design-Revised-Updated-Briefs/dp/1616890363?SubscriptionId=AKIAJZAKURNIAY4STOJQ&tag=karslucon-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=1616890363	27.04	54.0	4.0404040404	85.0804040404

Each exhibit is selected for its ubiquity, thematic import, and aesthetic significance, and every page shows how great work is derived from various inspirational and physical sources, some well-known, some unknown.

8	9780857858399		Paperback	Design as Future-Making brings together leading international designers, scholars, and critics to address ways in which design is shaping the future. The contributors share an understanding of design as a practice that, with its focus on innovation and newness, is a natural ally of futurity. Ultimately, the choices made by designers are understood here as choices about the kind of world we want to live in. Design as Future-Making locates design in a space of creative and critical reflection, examining the expanding nature of practice in fields such as biomedicine, sustainability, digital crafting, fashion, architecture, urbanism, and design activism. The authors contextualize design and its affects within issues of social justice, environmental health, political agency, education, and the right to pleasure and play. Collectively, they make the case that, as an integrated mode of thought and action, design is intrinsically social and deeply political.	https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51ebdhiqcQL.jpg	9780857858399	256	9	3618	3.90	0	Design as Future-Making	https://www.amazon.com/Design-as-Future-Making-Susan-Yelavich/dp/0857858394?SubscriptionId=AKIAJZAKURNIAY4STOJQ&tag=karslucon-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=0857858394	0.0	45.0	0.0	45.0

Sustainable by Design offers a compelling and innovative, design-centred approach that explores both the meaning and practice of sustainable design.

5	9780192842190	Jeffrey L. Meikle	Paperback	From the Cadillac to the Apple Mac, the skyscraper to the Tiffany lamp, the world in which we live has been profoundly influenced for over a century by the work of American designers. But the product is only the end of a story that is full of fascinating questions. What has been the social and cultural role of design in American society? To produce useful things that consumers need? Or to persuade them to buy things they don't need? Where does the designer stand in all of this? And how has the role of design in America changed over time, since the early days of the young Republic? Jeffrey Meikle explores the history of American design, from the hand-crafted furniture and artifacts of the early nineteenth century, through the era of industrialization and the mass production of the machine age, to the information-based society of the present, covering everything from the Arts and Crafts movement to Art Deco, modernism to post-modernism, the MOMA to the Tupperware bowl. Beautifully illustrated, Design in the USA also includes suggestions for further reading, a timeline, and a list of relevant museums and web sites. It is an excellent source of information for anyone seeking to uncover the imagination and industry behind American design.	https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41ataqYL2OL.jpg	9780192842190	252	19	3224	3.71	0	Design in the USA	https://www.amazon.com/Design-USA-Oxford-History-Art/dp/0192842196?SubscriptionId=AKIAJZAKURNIAY4STOJQ&tag=karslucon-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=0192842196	0.0	35.5	0.0	35.5

27	0134271467	Ted London	Paperback	"More and more enterprises are seeking to craft winning ""base of the pyramid"" (BoP) ventures, serving the world's four billion poorest customers while alleviating poverty at the same time. Early first-generation ventures focused primarily on selling products to this massive and growing under-served market. Many of these initiatives did not scale, and some have failed. Crucial lessons have been learned along the way, and innovators are now succeeding with a more sophisticated and nuanced approach to ""BoP."" These second-generation business strategies have remained invisible to many leaders in the for-profit, non-profit, and development communities--until now. In this book, Ted London, Stuart L. Hart, and nine leading BoP thought and practice leaders show how to apply today's most significant BoP innovations, techniques, and business models. London, Hart, and their contributors go beyond providing low-cost products and extending distribution reach, demonstrating how to promote market development, innovation, and capability creation ""with"" BoP new customers, not ""at"" them. Readers will learn how to reconceptualize their opportunities, create sustainable business ecosystems, design new technologies with BoP in mind, and even transform entire sectors through collaborative entrepreneurship. From start to finish, this book shares proven, ""on-the-ground"" insights for building scalable, profitable businesses that are sustainable, and truly can help alleviate social ills."	https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51DVQPu4AfL.jpg	9780134271460	288	22	2735	3.31	0	Next Generation Business Strategies for the Base of the Pyramid	https://www.amazon.com/Next-Generation-Business-Strategies-Pyramid/dp/0134271467?SubscriptionId=AKIAJZAKURNIAY4STOJQ&tag=karslucon-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=0134271467	10.6	15.5	0.0	26.1
