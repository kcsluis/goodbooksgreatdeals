Bottles, lost toys, small objects of every description are among his usual finds. But there's no way he could have prepared for one particular discovery: a barnacle-encrusted underwater camera, with its own secrets to share . . . and to keep. In each of his amazing picture books, David Wiesner has revealed the magical possibilities of some ordinary thing or happening--a frog on a lily pad, a trip to the Empire State Building, a well-known nursery tale. This time, a day at the beach is the springboard into a wildly imaginative exploration of the mysteries of the deep, and of the qualities that enable us to witness these wonders and delight in them.	https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51KzLXWY4LL.jpg	9780618194575	40	13	1660	4.25	23136	Flotsam	https://www.amazon.com/Flotsam-David-Wiesner/dp/0618194576?SubscriptionId=AKIAJZAKURNIAY4STOJQ&tag=karslucon-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=0618194576	53.6	62.5	100.0	216.1

But before that, he was a little boy who saw art everywhere: in poetry books and museums, in games and in the words that we speak, and in the pulsing energy of New York City. Now, award-winning illustrator Javaka Steptoe's vivid text and bold artwork echoing Basquiat's own introduce young readers to the powerful message that art doesn't always have to be neat or clean--and definitely not inside the lines--to be beautiful."	https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61Y4%2BcnccVL.jpg	9780316213882	40	5	1709	4.16	2407	Radiant Child: The Story of Young Artist Jean-Michel Basquiat	https://www.amazon.com/Radiant-Child-Jean-Michel-Childrens-Literature/dp/0316213888?SubscriptionId=AKIAJZAKURNIAY4STOJQ&tag=karslucon-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=0316213888	51.64	58.0	23.303030303	132.943030303

44	0374418977	Harve Zemach	Paperback	<p><i>Duffy and the Devil</i> was a popular play in Cornwall in the nineteenth century, performed at the Christmas season by groups of young people who went from house to house. The Zemachs have interpreted the folk tale which the play dramatized, recognizable as a version of the widespread Rumpelstiltskin story. Its main themes are familiar, but the character and details of this picture book are entirely Cornish, as robust and distinctive as the higgledy-piggledy, cliff-hanging villages that dot England's southwestern coast from Penzance to Land's End.</p><p>The language spoken by the Christmas players was a rich mixture of local English dialect and Old Cornish (similar to Welsh and Gaelic), and something of this flavor is preserved in Harve Zemach's retelling. Margot Zemach's pen-and-wash illustrations combine a refined sense of comedy with telling observation of character, felicitous drawing with decorative richness, to a degree that surpasses her own past accomplishments.</p><p><i>Duffy and the Devil</i> is a 1973 New York Times Book Review Notable Children's Book of the Year and Outstanding Book of the Year, a 1974 National Book Award Finalist for Children's Books, and the winner of the 1974 Caldecott Medal.</p>	https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/614TVJIcReL.jpg	9780374418977	40		999	3.40	916	Duffy and the Devil	https://www.amazon.com/Duffy-Devil-Sunburst-Harve-Zemach/dp/0374418977?SubscriptionId=AKIAJZAKURNIAY4STOJQ&tag=karslucon-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=0374418977	80.04	20.0	8.24242424242	108.282424242
