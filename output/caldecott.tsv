19	0547248296	Jacqueline Briggs Martin	Paperback	"""Of all the forms of water the tiny six-pointed crystals of ice called snow are incomparably the most beautiful and varied."" -- Wilson Bentley (1865-1931)From the time he was a small boy in Vermont, Wilson Bentley saw snowflakes as small miracles. And he determined that one day his camera would capture for others the wonder of the tiny crystal. Bentley's enthusiasm for photographing snowflakes was often misunderstood in his time, but his patience and determination revealed two important truths: no two snowflakes are alike; and each one is startlingly beautiful. His story is gracefully told and brought to life in lovely woodcuts, giving children insight into a soul who had not only a scientist's vision and perseverance but a clear passion for the wonders of nature. Snowflake Bentley won the 1999 Caldecott Medal."	https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61%2Bix41IEUL.jpg	9780547248295	32		799	4.17	12500	Snowflake Bentley	https://www.amazon.com/Snowflake-Bentley-Jacqueline-Briggs-Martin/dp/0547248296?SubscriptionId=AKIAJZAKURNIAY4STOJQ&tag=karslucon-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=0547248296	88.04	58.5	100.0	246.54

Bottles, lost toys, small objects of every description are among his usual finds. But there's no way he could have prepared for one particular discovery: a barnacle-encrusted underwater camera, with its own secrets to share . . . and to keep. In each of his amazing picture books, David Wiesner has revealed the magical possibilities of some ordinary thing or happening--a frog on a lily pad, a trip to the Empire State Building, a well-known nursery tale. This time, a day at the beach is the springboard into a wildly imaginative exploration of the mysteries of the deep, and of the qualities that enable us to witness these wonders and delight in them.	https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51KzLXWY4LL.jpg	9780618194575	40	17	1567	4.25	23400	Flotsam	https://www.amazon.com/Flotsam-David-Wiesner/dp/0618194576?SubscriptionId=AKIAJZAKURNIAY4STOJQ&tag=karslucon-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=0618194576	57.32	62.5	100.0	219.82

16	0618007016	David Wiesner	Hardcover	This Caldecott Medal-winning picture book begins placidly (and familiarly) enough, with three pigs collecting materials and going off to build houses of straw, sticks, and bricks. But the wolf’s huffing and puffing blows the first pig right out of the story . . . and into the realm of pure imagination. The transition signals the start of a freewheeling adventure with characteristic David Wiesner effects—cinematic flow, astonishing shifts of perspective, and sly humor, as well as episodes of flight. Satisfying both as a story and as an exploration of the nature of story, The Three Pigs takes visual narrative to a new level. Dialogue balloons, text excerpts, and a wide variety of illustration styles guide the reader through a dazzling fantasy universe to the surprising and happy ending. Fans of Tuesday’s frogs and Sector 7’s clouds will be captivated by old friends—the Three Pigs of nursery fame and their companions—in a new guise. 	https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51FB9c5g0iL.jpg	9780618007011	40	23	1456	4.15	18100	The Three Pigs	https://www.amazon.com/Three-Pigs-David-Wiesner/dp/0618007016?SubscriptionId=AKIAJZAKURNIAY4STOJQ&tag=karslucon-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=0618007016	61.76	57.5	100.0	219.26

But before that, he was a little boy who saw art everywhere: in poetry books and museums, in games and in the words that we speak, and in the pulsing energy of New York City. Now, award-winning illustrator Javaka Steptoe's vivid text and bold artwork echoing Basquiat's own introduce young readers to the powerful message that art doesn't always have to be neat or clean--and definitely not inside the lines--to be beautiful."	https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61Y4%2BcnccVL.jpg	9780316213882	40	5	1709	4.16	2500	Radiant Child: The Story of Young Artist Jean-Michel Basquiat	https://www.amazon.com/Radiant-Child-Jean-Michel-Childrens-Literature/dp/0316213888?SubscriptionId=AKIAJZAKURNIAY4STOJQ&tag=karslucon-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=0316213888	51.64	58.0	24.2424242424	133.882424242

44	0374418977	Harve Zemach	Paperback	Duffy and the Devil was a popular play in Cornwall in the nineteenth century, performed at the Christmas season by groups of young people who went from house to house. The Zemachs have interpreted the folk tale which the play dramatized, recognizable as a version of the widespread Rumpelstiltskin story. Its main themes are familiar, but the character and details of this picture book are entirely Cornish, as robust and distinctive as the higgledy-piggledy, cliff-hanging villages that dot England's southwestern coast from Penzance to Land's End.The language spoken by the Christmas players was a rich mixture of local English dialect and Old Cornish (similar to Welsh and Gaelic), and something of this flavor is preserved in Harve Zemach's retelling. Margot Zemach's pen-and-wash illustrations combine a refined sense of comedy with telling observation of character, felicitous drawing with decorative richness, to a degree that surpasses her own past accomplishments.Duffy and the Devil is a 1973 New York Times Book Review Notable Children's Book of the Year and Outstanding Book of the Year, a 1974 National Book Award Finalist for Children's Books, and the winner of the 1974 Caldecott Medal.	https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/614TVJIcReL.jpg	9780374418977	40		999	3.40	900	Duffy and the Devil	https://www.amazon.com/Duffy-Devil-Sunburst-Harve-Zemach/dp/0374418977?SubscriptionId=AKIAJZAKURNIAY4STOJQ&tag=karslucon-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=0374418977	80.04	20.0	8.08080808081	108.120808081
