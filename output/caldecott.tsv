19	0547248296	Jacqueline Briggs Martin	Paperback	"""Of all the forms of water the tiny six-pointed crystals of ice called snow are incomparably the most beautiful and varied."" -- Wilson Bentley (1865-1931)From the time he was a small boy in Vermont, Wilson Bentley saw snowflakes as small miracles. And he determined that one day his camera would capture for others the wonder of the tiny crystal. Bentley's enthusiasm for photographing snowflakes was often misunderstood in his time, but his patience and determination revealed two important truths: no two snowflakes are alike; and each one is startlingly beautiful. His story is gracefully told and brought to life in lovely woodcuts, giving children insight into a soul who had not only a scientist's vision and perseverance but a clear passion for the wonders of nature. Snowflake Bentley won the 1999 Caldecott Medal."	https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61%2Bix41IEUL.jpg	9780547248295	32		799	4.17	12400	Snowflake Bentley	https://www.amazon.com/Snowflake-Bentley-Jacqueline-Briggs-Martin/dp/0547248296?SubscriptionId=AKIAJZAKURNIAY4STOJQ&tag=karslucon-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=0547248296	88.04	58.5	100.0	246.54

But before that, he was a little boy who saw art everywhere: in poetry books and museums, in games and in the words that we speak, and in the pulsing energy of New York City. Now, award-winning illustrator Javaka Steptoe's vivid text and bold artwork echoing Basquiat's own introduce young readers to the powerful message that art doesn't always have to be neat or clean--and definitely not inside the lines--to be beautiful."	https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61Y4%2BcnccVL.jpg	9780316213882	40	5	1709	4.17	2400	Radiant Child: The Story of Young Artist Jean-Michel Basquiat	https://www.amazon.com/Radiant-Child-Jean-Michel-Childrens-Literature/dp/0316213888?SubscriptionId=AKIAJZAKURNIAY4STOJQ&tag=karslucon-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=0316213888	51.64	58.5	23.2323232323	133.372323232
44	0374418977	Harve Zemach	Paperback	Duffy and the Devil was a popular play in Cornwall in the nineteenth century, performed at the Christmas season by groups of young people who went from house to house. The Zemachs have interpreted the folk tale which the play dramatized, recognizable as a version of the widespread Rumpelstiltskin story. Its main themes are familiar, but the character and details of this picture book are entirely Cornish, as robust and distinctive as the higgledy-piggledy, cliff-hanging villages that dot England's southwestern coast from Penzance to Land's End.The language spoken by the Christmas players was a rich mixture of local English dialect and Old Cornish (similar to Welsh and Gaelic), and something of this flavor is preserved in Harve Zemach's retelling. Margot Zemach's pen-and-wash illustrations combine a refined sense of comedy with telling observation of character, felicitous drawing with decorative richness, to a degree that surpasses her own past accomplishments.Duffy and the Devil is a 1973 New York Times Book Review Notable Children's Book of the Year and Outstanding Book of the Year, a 1974 National Book Award Finalist for Children's Books, and the winner of the 1974 Caldecott Medal.	https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/614TVJIcReL.jpg	9780374418977	40	46	541	3.40	900	Duffy and the Devil	https://www.amazon.com/Duffy-Devil-Sunburst-Harve-Zemach/dp/0374418977?SubscriptionId=AKIAJZAKURNIAY4STOJQ&tag=karslucon-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=0374418977	98.36	20.0	8.08080808081	126.440808081
