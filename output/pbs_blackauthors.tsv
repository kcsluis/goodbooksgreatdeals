10	9781505223378	W.E.B. Du Bois	Paperback	The Souls of Black Folk is a classic work of American literature by W. E. B. Du Bois. It is a seminal work in the history of sociology, and a cornerstone of African-American literary history. To develop this groundbreaking work, Du Bois drew from his own experiences as an African-American in the American society. Outside of its notable relevance in African-American history, The Souls of Black Folk also holds an important place in social science as one of the early works in the field of sociology.	https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41xrfpHnGuL.jpg	9781505223378	124		589	4.27	27800	The Souls of Black Folk	https://www.amazon.com/Souls-Black-Folk-B-Bois/dp/1505223377?SubscriptionId=AKIAJZAKURNIAY4STOJQ&tag=karslucon-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=1505223377	96.44	63.5	100.0	259.94
0	0345514408	Maya Angelou	Mass Market Paperback	Here is a book as joyous and painful, as mysterious and memorable, as childhood itself. I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings captures the longing of lonely children, the brute insult of bigotry, and the wonder of words that can make the world right. Maya Angelou’s debut memoir is a modern American classic beloved worldwide.   Sent by their mother to live with their devout, self-sufficient grandmother in a small Southern town, Maya and her brother, Bailey, endure the ache of abandonment and the prejudice of the local “powhitetrash.” At eight years old and back at her mother’s side in St. Louis, Maya is attacked by a man many times her age—and has to live with the consequences for a lifetime. Years later, in San Francisco, Maya learns that love for herself, the kindness of others, her own strong spirit, and the ideas of great authors (“I met and fell in love with William Shakespeare”) will allow her to be free instead of imprisoned.   Poetic and powerful, I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings will touch hearts and change minds for as long as people read.   “I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings liberates the reader into life simply because Maya Angelou confronts her own life with such a moving wonder, such a luminous dignity.”—James Baldwin	https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41SKsBaGXRL.jpg	9780345514400	304	20	639	4.21	329900	I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings	https://www.amazon.com/Know-Why-Caged-Bird-Sings/dp/0345514408?SubscriptionId=AKIAJZAKURNIAY4STOJQ&tag=karslucon-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=0345514408	94.44	60.5	100.0	254.94

Go Tell It On The Mountain, first published in 1953, is Baldwin's first major work, a novel that has established itself as an American classic.

4	9780807006238	James Baldwin	Paperback	#26 on The Guardian's list of 100 best nonfiction books of all time, the essays explore what it means to be Black in AmericaIn an age of Black Lives Matter, James Baldwin's essays on life in Harlem, the protest novel, movies, and African Americans abroad are as powerful today as when they were first written. With films like I Am Not Your Negro and the forthcoming If Beale Street Could Talk bringing renewed interest to Baldwin's life and work, Notes of a Native Son serves as a valuable introduction.Written during the 1940s and early 1950s, when Baldwin was only in his twenties, the essays collected in Notes of a Native Son capture a view of black life and black thought at the dawn of the civil rights movement and as the movement slowly gained strength through the words of one of the most captivating essayists and foremost intellectuals of that era. Writing as an artist, activist, and social critic, Baldwin probes the complex condition of being black in America. With a keen eye, he examines everything from the significance of the protest novel to the motives and circumstances of the many black expatriates of the time, from his home in “The Harlem Ghetto” to a sobering “Journey to Atlanta.” Notes of a Native Son inaugurated Baldwin as one of the leading interpreters of the dramatic social changes erupting in the United States in the twentieth century, and many of his observations have proven almost prophetic. His criticism on topics such as the paternalism of white progressives or on his own friend Richard Wright’s work is pointed and unabashed. He was also one of the few writing on race at the time who addressed the issue with a powerful mixture of outrage at the gross physical and political violence against black citizens and measured understanding of their oppressors, which helped awaken a white audience to the injustices under their noses. Naturally, this combination of brazen criticism and unconventional empathy for white readers won Baldwin as much condemnation as praise. Notes is the book that established Baldwin’s voice as a social critic, and it remains one of his most admired works. The essays collected here create a cohesive sketch of black America and reveal an intimate portrait of Baldwin’s own search for identity as an artist, as a black man, and as an American.	https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41OdFo54Y8L.jpg	9780807006238	192		1500	4.36	10600	Notes of a Native Son	https://www.amazon.com/Notes-Native-Son-James-Baldwin/dp/0807006238?SubscriptionId=AKIAJZAKURNIAY4STOJQ&tag=karslucon-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=0807006238	60.0	68.0	100.0	228.0

He lied, stole, and raged at those around him; at six he was a ""drunkard,"" hanging about in taverns.

Of the millions of men, women, and children transported from Africa to America as slaves, Cudjo was then the only person alive to tell the story of this integral part of the nation’s history. Hurston was there to record Cudjo’s firsthand account of the raid that led to his capture and bondage fifty years after the Atlantic slave trade was outlawed in the United States.In 1931, Hurston returned to Plateau, the African-centric community three miles from Mobile founded by Cudjo and other former slaves from his ship. Spending more than three months there, she talked in depth with Cudjo about the details of his life. During those weeks, the young writer and the elderly formerly enslaved man ate peaches and watermelon that grew in the backyard and talked about Cudjo’s past—memories from his childhood in Africa, the horrors of being captured and held in a barracoon for selection by American slavers, the harrowing experience of the Middle Passage packed with more than 100 other souls aboard the Clotilda, and the years he spent in slavery until the end of the Civil War.Based on those interviews, featuring Cudjo’s unique vernacular, and written from Hurston’s perspective with the compassion and singular style that have made her one of the preeminent American authors of the twentieth-century, Barracoon masterfully illustrates the tragedy of slavery and of one life forever defined by it. Offering insight into the pernicious legacy that continues to haunt us all, black and white, this poignant and powerful work is an invaluable contribution to our shared history and culture."	https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51RD7cKm8pL.jpg	9780062748201	208	54	1150	4.08	7000	Barracoon	https://www.amazon.com/Barracoon-Story-Last-Black-Cargo/dp/0062748203?SubscriptionId=AKIAJZAKURNIAY4STOJQ&tag=karslucon-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=0062748203	74.0	54.0	69.696969697	197.696969697
17	067972818X	Langston Hughes	Paperback	"With the publication of his first book of poems, The Weary Blues, in 1926, Langston Hughes electrified readers and launched a renaissance in black writing in America.  The poems Hughes wrote celebrated the experience of invisible men and women: of slaves who ""rushed the boots of Washington""; of musicians on Lenox Avenue; of the poor and the lovesick; of losers in ""the raffle of night.""  They conveyed that experience in a voice that blended the spoken with the sung, that turned poetic lines into the phrases of jazz and blues, and that ripped through the curtain separating high from popular culture.  They spanned the range from the lyric to the polemic, ringing out ""wonder and pain and terror-- and the marrow of the bone of life.""The poems in this collection were chosen by Hughes himself shortly before his death in 1967 and represent work from his entire career, including ""The Negro Speaks of Rivers,"" ""The Weary Blues,"" ""Still Here,"" ""Song for a Dark Girl,"" ""Montage of a Dream Deferred,"" and ""Refugee in America.""  It gives us a poet of extraordinary range, directness, and stylistic virtuosity."	https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/513KbIkinQL.jpg	9780679728184	320	16	1352	4.29	6000	Selected Poems	https://www.amazon.com/Selected-Poems-Langston-Hughes-Collection/dp/067972818X?SubscriptionId=AKIAJZAKURNIAY4STOJQ&tag=karslucon-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=067972818X	65.92	64.5	59.595959596	190.015959596

5	068818474X	Leroi Jones	Paperback	"""The path the slave took to 'citizenship' is what I want to look at. And I make my analogy through the slave citizen's music -- through the music that is most closely associated with him: blues and a later, but parallel development, jazz... [If] the Negro represents, or is symbolic of, something in and about the nature of American culture, this certainly should be revealed by his characteristic music.""So says Amiri Baraka in the Introduction to Blues People, his classic work on the place of jazz and blues in American social, musical, economic, and cultural history. From the music of African slaves in the United States through the music scene of the 1960's, Baraka traces the influence of what he calls ""negro music"" on white America -- not only in the context of music and pop culture but also in terms of the values and perspectives passed on through the music. In tracing the music, he brilliantly illuminates the influence of African Americans on American culture and history."	https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61rBClZyzCL.jpg	9780688184742	256	21	1259	4.13	1800	Blues People: Negro Music in White America	https://www.amazon.com/Blues-People-Negro-Music-America/dp/068818474X?SubscriptionId=AKIAJZAKURNIAY4STOJQ&tag=karslucon-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=068818474X	69.64	56.5	17.1717171717	143.311717172

With its publication, a giant world of literature has just grown twice as tall.""--NewsdayFrom Ralph Ellison--author of the classic novel of African-American experience, Invisible Man--the long-awaited second novel. Here is the master of American vernacular--the rhythms of jazz and gospel and ordinary speech--at the height of his powers, telling a powerful, evocative tale of a prodigal of the twentieth century. ""Tell me what happened while there's still time,"" demands the dying Senator Adam Sunraider to the itinerate Negro preacher whom he calls Daddy Hickman. As a young man, Sunraider was Bliss, an orphan taken in by Hickman and raised to be a preacher like himself. Bliss's history encompasses the joys of young southern boyhood; bucolic days as a filmmaker, lovemaking in a field in the Oklahoma sun. And behind it all lies a mystery: how did this chosen child become the man who would deny everything to achieve his goals? Brilliantly crafted, moving, wise, Juneteenth is the work of an American master."	https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51R-GQBcRBL.jpg	9780375707544	400	20	1357	3.61	1100	Juneteenth	https://www.amazon.com/Juneteenth-Novel-Ralph-Ellison/dp/0375707549?SubscriptionId=AKIAJZAKURNIAY4STOJQ&tag=karslucon-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=0375707549	65.72	30.5	10.101010101	106.321010101
6	0802124682	Amiri Baraka	Paperback	One of the New York Times Book Review's 100 Notable BooksWITH AN APPENDIX OF NEVER-BEFORE-PUBLISHED WORKFusing the personal and the political in high-voltage verse, Amiri Baraka was one of the preeminent literary innovators of the past century. This volume comprises the fullest spectrum of his rousing, revolutionary poems, from his first collection to unpublished pieces composed during his final years.Throughout Barakaâ€™s career as a prolific writer in several genres (also published under the name LeRoi Jones), he was vehemently outspoken against oppression of African American citizens, and he radically altered the discourse surrounding racial inequality. His legacy in world literature is matched by his widespread influence as an activist and cultural leader. Praised for its lyricism and introspection, his early poetry emerged from the Beat generation, while his later writing is marked by the Black Arts Movement's intensely rebellious fervor and subversive ideology. All along, his primary focus was on how to live and love in the present moment despite the enduring difficulties of human history.	https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51SYYjdoD%2BL.jpg	9780802124685	624		2000	4.24	100	S O S: Poems 1961-2013	https://www.amazon.com/S-Poems-1961-2013-Amiri-Baraka/dp/0802124682?SubscriptionId=AKIAJZAKURNIAY4STOJQ&tag=karslucon-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=0802124682	40.0	62.0	0.0	102.0
